One powerful feature of the Raspberry Pi is the row of GPIO pins along the top edge of the board. GPIO stands for *General Purpose Input Output*. These pins are a physical interface between the Pi and the outside world. It is a way in which the Raspberry Pi can control and monitor the outside world by being connected to electronic circuits. The Pi is able to control LEDs, turning them on or off, or motors, or many other things. It is also able to detect whether a switch has been pressed, or temperature, or light. We refer to this as **physical computing**.

This guide will introduce you to the basics of electronics and getting started with physical computing with the Raspberry Pi.
