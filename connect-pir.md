# Connecting a PIR Motion Sensor

1. Before booting your Raspberry Pi, connect the Passive Infrared (PIR) module to the Raspberry Pi.

1. Using three female-to-female jumper cables, you'll need to connect each of the PIR sensor's connectors to the appropriate pins on the Raspberry Pi.

1. Connect the top one labelled `VCC` on the PIR sensor to the 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi, connect the middle one labelled `OUT` to GPIO pin 4, and connect the bottom one labelled `GND` to a ground pin also marked `GND`. All shown in the following diagram:

1. Now boot your Pi and log in.
